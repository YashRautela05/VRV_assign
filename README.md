# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI

## **Overview**
This project is a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) User Interface designed to manage users, roles, and permissions in a secure and user-friendly manner. The application is built with flexibility and creativity in mind, allowing administrators to efficiently assign roles, define permissions, and manage user statuses.

---

## **Features**

### **User Management**
- View and manage a list of users.
- Add, edit, or delete user profiles.
- Assign roles to users and manage their status (e.g., Active/Inactive).

### **Role Management**
- Create and define new roles.
- Edit existing roles and their attributes.
- Assign permissions (e.g., Read, Write, Delete) or custom attributes to roles.

### **Dynamic Permissions**
- Assign or modify permissions dynamically for each role.
- Display permissions in a clear and user-friendly manner for easy management.

### **Custom API Simulation (Optional)**
- Mock API calls for CRUD operations on users and roles.
- Simulate server responses to validate functionality.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend Framework:** [React/Angular/Vue] (choose based on preference)
- **CSS Framework:** [Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS/Material UI] (optional for styling)
- **API Simulation:** Mock APIs using [JSON Server/Axios] or custom-built functions
